# Neural Network Ethnicity Recognition

Neural Network Ethnicity Recognition is a project designed to identify the ethnicity of individuals based on image recognition using a neural network.

## Features

- Upload and predict ethnicity from images.
- View the history of predictions.
- Visualize model performance and data distribution.

## Project Overview

This project is a neural network application designed to recognize the ethnicity of a person based on image recognition. It uses TensorFlow for model training and prediction, FastAPI for the backend, and React.js for the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- TensorFlow
- FastAPI
- React.js

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up MongoDB and ensure it is running. Update the MongoDB URI in the `.env` file.

4. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Predicting Ethnicity

To predict the ethnicity of an individual from an image:

1. Upload an image using the frontend interface.
2. The image will be processed by the FastAPI backend and the ethnicity will be predicted using the TensorFlow model.
3. The result will be displayed on the frontend.

### Viewing History

You can view the history of previous predictions through the `/history` endpoint which will show the recent predictions stored in the MongoDB database.

## File Descriptions

- `model/ethnicity_model.h5`: The pre-trained TensorFlow model for ethnicity recognition.
- `model/main.py`: Script for training the model.
- `model/prediction.py`: Script for loading the model and making predictions.
- `model/vis.py`: Script for data visualization.
- `server/main.py`: FastAPI backend implementation.
- `client/src/index.html`: Entry point for the React frontend.
- `client/src/main.jsx`: Main React component.
